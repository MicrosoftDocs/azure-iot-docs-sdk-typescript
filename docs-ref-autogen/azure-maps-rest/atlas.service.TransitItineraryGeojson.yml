    summary: >-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the itinerary.

      Each feature in the collection is a `LineString` representing one leg of
      the itinerary.

      Legs which don't specify start and end positions will be omitted from the
      collection,

      e.g. `"Wait"` or sometimes `"PathWayWalk"`.

      If geometry details were requested the LineStrings will follow those
      geometries.

      If geometry details were not requested the LineStrings will directly
      connect the start and end points of the leg.

      The properties of each feature match the properties of the `Leg`, except

      the `geometry`, `origin`, and `destination` properties is omitted

      because they are redundant with the feature's coordinates.
