      information. For routes planned with departure time in the future, delays

      return additional travel times using different types of traffic
      information, parameter

      Estimated travel time in seconds property that includes the delay due to
      real-time traffic.

      Note that even when traffic=false travelTimeInSeconds still includes the
      delay due to traffic.

      If DepartAt is in the future, travel time is calculated using
      time-dependent historic traffic

      data.
