    summary: >-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the results.

      The collection will include a Point feature for each of the `geometries`.

      The properties of the features match the properties of the geofence
      geometry,

      except the `nearestLat` and `nearestLon` properties are omitted

      because they are redundant with the feature's coordinates.
