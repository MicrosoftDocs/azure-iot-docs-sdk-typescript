      Returns  a route between an origin and a destination, passing through
      waypoints if they are

      specified. The route will take into account factors such as current
      traffic and the typical road

      speeds on the requested day of the week and time of day.

      Information returned includes the distance, estimated travel time, and a
      representation of the

      route geometry. Additional routing information such as optimized waypoint
      order or turn by turn

      instructions is also available, depending on the options selected.


      Routing service provides a set of parameters for a detailed description of

      **Note: This API is currently in preview and may be subject to breaking
      changes.**

      Calculates a matrix of route summaries for a set of routes

      defined by origin and destination locations. For every given origin, this
      service calculates the

      cost of routing from that origin to every given destination. The set of
      origins and the set of

      destinations can be thought of as the column and row headers of a table
      and each cell in the

      table contains the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for
      that cell. For each

      route, the travel times and distances are calculated. You can use the
      computed costs to

      determine which routes to calculate using the Routing Directions API. If
      waitForResults

      parameter in the request is set to false (default value), this API returns
      a 202 response code

      along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response header. This
      URL should be checked

      periodically until the response data or error information is available.

      The maximum size of a matrix for this API is 700 (the number of origins 
      multiplied by the

      number of destinations). With that constraint in mind,  examples of
      possible matrix dimensions

      are: 50x10, 10x10, 28x25. 10x70  (it does not need to be square).


      Calculating a route matrix is considered a long running operation.

      A long running operations implies that after the initial request is
      accepted (HTTP 202)

      the final result will be polled for until available.

      Each poll request restarts the aborter's timeout, if one was specified.
