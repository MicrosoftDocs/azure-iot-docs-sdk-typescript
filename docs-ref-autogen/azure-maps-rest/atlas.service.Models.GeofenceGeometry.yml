    summary: >-
      Distance from the coordinate to the closest border of the geofence.
      Positive means the

      coordinate is outside of the geofence. If the coordinate is outside of the
      geofence, but more

      than the value of searchBuffer away from the closest geofence border, then
      the value is 999.

      Negative means the coordinate is inside of the geofence. If the coordinate
      is inside the

      polygon, but more than the value of searchBuffer away from the closest
      geofencing border, then

      the value is -999. A value of 999 means that there is great confidence the
      coordinate is well

      outside the geofence. A value of -999 means that there is great confidence
      the coordinate is

      well within the geofence.

      case-sensitive.
