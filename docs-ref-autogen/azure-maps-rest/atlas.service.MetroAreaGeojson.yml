      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the results.

      Each feature in the collection is a Polygon representing one area.

      The properties of each feature match the properties of the
      `MetroAreaResult`, except

      the `geometry` property is omitted because it is redundant with the
      feature's geometry.
