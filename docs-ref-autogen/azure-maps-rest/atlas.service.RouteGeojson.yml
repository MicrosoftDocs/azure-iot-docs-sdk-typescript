    summary: >-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the routes.

      Each feature in the collection is a MultiLineString representing one
      route.

      The MultiLineString contains LineStrings representing a leg of the route.

      The properties of each feature match the properties of the `route`, except

      the `legs` property is replaced by a `legSummaries` property which is an
      array

      of the summaries of each leg. The coordinates of each leg are already part

      of the MultiLineString's coordinates. Each feature's properties also
      includes

      a resultIndex. The resultIndex is the index of the route within the
      original `routes` array.
