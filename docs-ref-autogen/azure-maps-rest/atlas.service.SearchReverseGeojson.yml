    summary: |-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the addresses.
      Each feature in the collection is a Point representing one address.
      The properties of each feature match the properties of the `address`,
      except the `position` property is omitted because it is already the
      coordinate of the point. Each feature's properties also includes
      a resultIndex. The resultIndex is the index of the route within the
      original `addresses` array.
