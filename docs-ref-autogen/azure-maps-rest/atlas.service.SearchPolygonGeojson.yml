    summary: >-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the results.

      Each feature in the collection is a Polygon or MultiPolygon representing
      one geometry ID.

      The properties of each feature match the properties of `additionalData`,

      except the `geometryData` is omitted because it is redundant with the
      feature itself.

      The properties of the features in `geometryData` are kept too.
