      A Device Twin is document describing the state of a device that is stored
      by an Azure IoT hub and is available even if the device is offline.

      It is built around 3 sections:
        - Tags: key/value pairs only accessible from the service side
        - Desired Properties: updated by a service and received by the device
        - Reported Properties: updated by the device and received by the service.
      Note that although it is a possibility, desired and reported properties do
      not have to match

      and that the logic to sync these two collections, if necessary, is left to
      the user of the SDK.


      For more information see [Understanding Device
      Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins).
