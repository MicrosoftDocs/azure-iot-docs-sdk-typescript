      Estimated delay in seconds caused by the real-time incident(s) according

      return additional travel times using different types of traffic
      information, parameter

      computeTravelTimeFor=all needs to be added.

      Estimated travel time in seconds property that includes the delay due to
      real-time traffic.

      Note that even when traffic=false travelTimeInSeconds still includes the
      delay due to traffic.

      If DepartAt is in the future, travel time is calculated using
      time-dependent historic traffic

      data.
