      A comma-separated list of connector types which could be used to restrict
      the result to

      Electric Vehicle Station supporting specific connector types. Item order
      does not matter. When

      multiple connector types are provided, only results that belong to (at
      least) one of the

      provided list will be returned.


      Available connector types are:

      * `StandardHouseholdCountrySpecific` - These are the standard household
      connectors for a

      certain region. They are all AC single phase and the standard Voltage and
      standard Amperage.

      See also: [Plug & socket types - World

      Standards](https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets).

      * `IEC62196Type1` - Type 1 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2
      standard. Also called

      Yazaki after the original manufacturer or SAE J1772 after the standard
      that first published

      it. Mostly used in combination with 120V single phase or up to 240V single
      phase

      infrastructure.

      * `IEC62196Type1CCS` - Type 1 based combo connector as defined in the IEC
      62196-3 standard.

      The connector is based on the Type 1 connector – as defined in the IEC
      62196-2 standard – with

      two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow DC fast charging.

      * `IEC62196Type2CableAttached` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC
      62196-2 standard.

      Provided as a cable and plug attached to the charging point.

      * `IEC62196Type2Outlet` - Type 2 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2
      standard. Provided as

      a socket set into the charging point.

      * `IEC62196Type2CCS` - Type 2 based combo connector as defined in the IEC
      62196-3 standard.

      The connector is based on the Type 2 connector – as defined in the IEC
      62196-2 standard – with

      two additional direct current (DC) contacts to allow DC fast charging.

      * `IEC62196Type3` - Type 3 connector as defined in the IEC 62196-2
      standard. Also called Scame

      after the original manufacturer. Mostly used in combination with up to
      240V single phase or up

      to 420V three phase infrastructure.

      * `Chademo` - CHAdeMO connector named after an association formed by the
      Tokyo Electric Power

      Company and industrial partners. Because of this is is also known as the
      TEPCO's connector. It

      supports fast DC charging.

      * `IEC60309AC1PhaseBlue` - Industrial Blue connector is a connector
      defined in the IEC 60309

      standard. It is sometime referred to as by some combination of the
      standard, the color and the

      fact that is a single phase connector. The connector usually has the
      "P+N+E, 6h"

      configuration.

      * `IEC60309DCWhite` - Industrial White connector is a DC connector defined
      in the IEC 60309

      standard.

      * `Tesla` - The Tesla connector is the regionally specific Tesla
      Supercharger connector. I.e.

      it refers to either Tesla's proprietary connector, sometimes referred to
      as Tesla Port mostly

      limited to North America or the modified Type 2 (DC over Type 2) in
      Europe.

      The View parameter specifies which set of geopolitically disputed content
      is returned via

      Azure Maps services, including  borders and labels displayed on the map.
      The View parameter

      (also referred to as “user region parameter”) will show the  correct maps
      for that

      country/region. By default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if
      you haven’t defined

      it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the location of
      your users, and

      then set the View parameter correctly  for that location. Alternatively,
      you have the option

      to set ‘View=Auto’, which will return the map data based on the IP 
      address of the request.

      The View parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with
      applicable laws, including

      those  regarding mapping, of the country where maps, images and other data
      and third party

      content that you are authorized to  access via Azure Maps is made
      available. Example: view=IN.
