    summary: >-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the results.

      Each feature in the collection is a Point representing one transit object.

      The properties of each feature match the properties of the
      `TransitObjectResult`, except

      the `position` property is omitted because it is redundant with the
      feature's coordinates.
