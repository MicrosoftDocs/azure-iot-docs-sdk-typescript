      Options structure used to configure how often the HTTP receiver polls for
      messages.

      Each of these options is mutually exclusive, except for the `drain`
      boolean. Only one `interval`, `at`, `cron` or `manualPolling` shall be
      present in the options structure.

      This is configured by calling <xref:azure-iot-device.Client.setOptions>
      with an options structure following this format:

      ```js

      {
        http: {
          receivePolicy: {
            ...
          }
        }
      }

      ```
