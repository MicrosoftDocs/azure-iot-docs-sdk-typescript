      **Address Geocoding** In many cases, the complete search service might be
      too much, for

      instance if you are only interested in traditional geocoding.

      Search can also be accessed for address look up exclusively.

      The geocoding is performed by hitting the geocode endpoint with just the
      address or

      partial address in question.

      The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above the street
      level data.

      No POIs will be returned.

      Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses.

      It will also handle everything from exact street addresses or street or
      intersections

      as well as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states
      etc.

      The Search Along Route endpoint allows you to perform a fuzzy search for
      POIs along a specified

      route.

      This search is constrained by specifying the `maxDetourTime` limiting
      measure.

      To send the route-points you will use a `body` which will contain the
      `route` object represented

      as a `GeoJSON LineString` type and the `Content-Type` header will be set
      to `application/json`.

      Each route-point in `route` is represented as a `GeoJSON Position` type
      i.e. an array where the

      _longitude_ value is followed by the _latitude_ value and the _altitude_
      value is ignored.

      The `route` should contain at least 2 route-points.

      It is possible that original route will be altered, some of it's points
      may be skipped.

      If the route that passes through the found point is faster than the
      original one, the `detourTime` value in

      the response is negative.

      **Free Form Search** The basic default API is Free Form Search which
      handles the most

      fuzzy of inputs handling any combination of address or POI tokens.

      This search API is the canonical 'single line search'.

      The Free Form Search API is a seamless combination of POI search and
      geocoding.

      The API can also be weighted with a contextual position (lat./lon. pair),
      or

      fully constrained by a coordinate and radius, or it can be executed more
      generally without any

      geo biasing anchor point.

      We strongly advise you to use the 'countrySet' parameter to specify only
      the countries for

      which your application needs coverage, as the default behavior will be to
      search the entire world,

      potentially returning unnecessary results. E.g.: `countrySet`=US,FR.
      Please see [Search Coverage]

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/location-based-services/geocoding-coverage)
      for

      a complete list of all the supported countries.

      Most Search queries default to `maxFuzzyLevel`=2 to gain performance and
      also reduce unusual results.

      This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing in the
      query param `maxFuzzyLevel`=3 or 4.

      The Search Geometry endpoint allows you to perform a free form search

      or many of them.

      The search results that fall inside the geometry/geometries will be
      returned.

      The geographical features to be searched can be modeled as Polygon and/or
      Circle geometries

      represented using any one of the following `GeoJSON` types: **GeoJSON
      FeatureCollection**,

      The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON FeatureCollection` object.

      This is the recommended option if the geometry contains both Polygons and
      Circles.

      The `FeatureCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Feature` objects.

      Each `Feature` object should represent either a Polygon or a Circle with
      the following conditions:

      A `Feature` object for the Polygon geometry can have a max of 50
      coordinates and it's properties must be empty.

      A `Feature` object for the Circle geometry is composed of a _center_
      represented using a `GeoJSON Point` type and a _radius_ value

      (in meters) which must be specified in the object's properties along with
      the _subType_ property

      whose value should be 'Circle'.

      Please see the Examples section below for a sample `FeatureCollection`
      representation.

      **GeoJSON GeometryCollection**, The `geometry` can be represented as a
      `GeoJSON GeometryCollection` object.

      This is the recommended option if the geometry contains a list of Polygons
      only.

      The `GeometryCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Polygon`
      objects.

      Each `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates.

      Please see the Examples section below for a sample `GeometryCollection`

    summary: >
      The Search Polygon API allows you to request the geometry data such as a
      city or country

      outline for a set of entities, previously retrieved from an Online Search
      request in GeoJSON

      format. The geometry  ID is returned in the dataSources object under
      "geometry" and "id" in

      either a Search Address or Search Fuzzy call.

      Please note that any geometry ID retrieved from an Online Search endpoint
      has a limited

      lifetime. The client  should not store geometry IDs in persistent storage
      for later referral, as

      the stability of these identifiers is  not guaranteed for a long period of
      time. It is expected

      that a request to the Polygon method is made within a  few minutes of the
      request to the Online

      Search method that provided the ID. The service allows for batch  requests
      up to 20 identifiers.
