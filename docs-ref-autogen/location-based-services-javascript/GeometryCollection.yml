      GeoJSON object with type "GeometryCollection" is a Geometry object. A
      GeometryCollection has a member with the name

      "geometries". The value of "geometries" is an array. Each element of this
      array is a GeoJSON Geometry object. It is

      possible for this array to be empty. The full description is detailed in

      [RFC 7946]{@link https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946}.
