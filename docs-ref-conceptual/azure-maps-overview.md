The Azure Maps Web Control lets you customize interactive maps with your own content and imagery for display in your web or mobile applications. This control makes use of WebGL, allowing you to render large data sets with high performance. Develop with the control using JavaScript or TypeScript.
In addition to the web control, there is also an Azure Maps Services library which wraps all the Azure Maps REST services into an easy to use web library that you can develop against using JavaScript or TypeScript.
