      The IoT Hub service client is used to communicate with devices through an
      Azure IoT hub.

      It lets the SDK user:
        - send device-to-cloud (also known as commands) to devices: commands are queued on IoT Hub and delivered asynchronously only when the device is connected. Only 50 commands can be queued per device.
        - invoke direct methods on devices (which will work only if the device is currently connected: it's a synchronous way of communicating with the device)
        - listen for feedback messages sent by devices for previous commands.
        - listen for file upload notifications from devices.
      Users should create new <xref:azure-iothub.Client> instances by calling
      one of the factory methods,

      [fromConnectionString](xref:azure-iothub.Client.fromConnectionString) or

      [fromSharedAccessSignature](xref:azure-iothub.Client.fromSharedAccessSignature),

      to create an IoT Hub service Client.
