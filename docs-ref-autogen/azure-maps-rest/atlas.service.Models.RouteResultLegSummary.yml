      Model. Included if vehicleEngineType is set to electric and

      batteryConsumptionInkWh

      includes the recuperated electric energy and can therefore be negative
      (which indicates

      gaining energy). If both maxChargeInkWh and currentChargeInkWh are

      will be capped to ensure that the battery charge level never exceeds
      maxChargeInkWh. If

      neither maxChargeInkWh nor currentChargeInkWh are specified, unconstrained
      recuperation is

      assumed in the consumption calculation.
