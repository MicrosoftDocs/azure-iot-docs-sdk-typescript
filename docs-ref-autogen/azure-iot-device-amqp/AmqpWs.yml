      Constructs a transport object that can be used by the device
      <xref:azure-iot-device.Client> to send and receive messages to and from an
      IoT Hub instance, using the AMQP protocol over secure websockets.

      This class overloads the constructor of the base
      <xref:azure-iot-device-amqp.Amqp> class from the AMQP transport, and
