    summary: >-
      Returns a GeoJSON feature collection built from the results.

      The collection will include one Point feature representing the input.

      The properties of the feature match the properties of the `result` and
      `summary`,

      except the `sourcePoint` will be omitted because it is redundant with the
      feature's coordinates.
